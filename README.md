# Ola-Data-Analytics-project using SQL and Power BI

In this project, I created an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze Ola ride data and provide meaningful insights for business decisions and I also perform this project on SQL to extract useful insights for dashboard.

## Key Tasks
-Data Cleaning: Removed inconsistencies,handled null values,date/time formats and organized dataset for easy import in Power BI.
-Dashboard Creation: Created visualizations such as total rides,Revenue,Ride Cancellation,Ratings.Used slicers and filters for dynamic interaction based on date.
-SQL: Perform various functions on SQL to understad the insights.
